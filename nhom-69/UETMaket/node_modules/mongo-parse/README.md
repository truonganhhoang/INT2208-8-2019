`mongo-parse`
============

A parser for mongo db queries and projections. You can use this to analyze, modify, and match against MongoDb queries, as well as test projections for inclusiveness or exclusiveness.

Example:

```javascript
var parser = require('mongo-parse')
var ObjectId = require('mongodb').ObjectId

var query = parser.parse({ "powerlevel": { $gt: 9000 }})
// query.parts contains: [{field: 'powerlevel', operator: '$gt', operand: 9000}]

var query2 = {$and:[{userId: "507f191e810c19729de860ea"},  {animal: {$in: ['beefalo', 'deerclops']}}]}
var newQuery = parser.parse(query2).mapValues(function(field, stringId) {
   if(field === 'userId')
       return ObjectId(stringId)  // change a string ID into an ObjectId when you need to
   else
       return stringId
})
// newQuery is {$and:[{userId: ObjectId("29g8j3h27fh382dh82ae23")}, {animal: {$in: ['beefalo', 'deerclops']}}]}

parser.parse(newQuery).matches({userId: ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea"), animal: 'deerclops'}) // returns true
```

Install
=======

```
npm install mongo-parse
```

Usage
=====

```javascript
var parser = require('mongo-parse')
```

**`var queryObject = parser.parse(mongoQuery)`** - Returns an object that contains a list of query parts, and methods for interacting with the query.

**`queryObject.parts`** - A list of QueryPart objects.

**`queryObject.mapValues(function(field, value) {...})`** - Returns a new mongo query object with values mapped based on the passed in 
      callback. The callback will be called for each leaf-node in the query. 
      For example, in the query `{x:1, $and:[{y:2,z:3}]}`, the callback will be called 3 times.
      The value returned from the callback function will replace the original value in the new returned query.
      Query parts that don't relate to a field may not trigger the callback. The callback's parameters:

* `field` - The field the query part is for. E.g. for `{x:1}`, the field will be `"x"`. Can be `undefined` for certain query parts that don't relate to a specific field (e.g. the `$text` operator).
* `value` - The value that query part is querying with. E.g. for `{x:1}`, the value will be `1`.

**`queryObject.map(function(field, value) {...})`** - Returns a new mongo query object with query parts mapped based on the 
        return value of the passed-in callback. 
        The callback will be called for each leaf-node in the query. 
        For example, in the query `{x:1, $and:[{y:2,z:3}]}`, the callback will be called 3 times.
        If the value returned from the callback is `null`, the original query part will be removed.
        If the value returned from the callback is `undefined`, the original query part will be kept.        
        Otherwise, the query part will be replaced with the query parts contained in the returned query object.
        Query parts that don't relate to a field may not trigger the callback. The callback's parameters:

* `field` - The field the query part is for. E.g. for `{x:1}`, the field will be `"x"`. Can be `undefined` for certain query parts that don't relate to a specific field (e.g. the `$text` operator).
* `value` - The value that query part is querying with. E.g. for `{x:1}`, the value will be `1`.

**`queryObject.matches(document, validate)`** - Returns true if the query matches the passed mongodb `document` object. The following mongo operators are supported: basic equality ({field:value}), $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $ne, $in, $nin, $all, $mod, $exists, $regex, $size, $elemMatch, $not, $and, $or, $nor, $where (and implicit where - passing a function), $comment. The following mongo operators are not yet supported $geoIntersects, $geoWithin, $nearSphere, $near, $text, projection operators ($, $meta, $slice)

* `validate` - (Optional - Default: true) Whether to validate that the passed document is a correctly structured mongo document or not.

**`parser.search(documents, query, sort, validate)`** - Returns the list of matching `documents` sorted.

* `documents` - The array of documents to search.
* `query` - The mongo query to search with.
* `sort` - (Optional) A mongo sort definition to sort by.
* `validate` - (Optional - Default: true) Whether to validate that the passed document is a correctly structured mongo document or not.

**`parser.inclusive(mongoProjection)`** - Returns `true` if the projection is inclusive, `false` if it is exclusive, and `undefined` if it is neither. If it is neither, you may either add more exclusive terms or more inclusive terms. Note that fields using the `$elemMatch` or `$slice` [projection operators](https://docs.mongodb.org/v2.6/reference/operator/projection/) can be used with both inclusive and exclusive queries and so have no bearing on inclusiveness. See [here for more info on projections](https://docs.mongodb.org/v2.6/reference/method/db.collection.find/).

**`parser.compressQuery(query)`** - Returns the same query but shortened, but collapsing $ands, $ors, and $eqs.

QueryPart
--------------

A QueryPart contains the following properties:

* **`field`** - The field a query part relates to. Can be `undefined` if the queryPart doesn't related to a specific field.
* **`operator`** - The operator of a query part.
* **`operand`** - The operand for a query part. This is the whole value or object contained for the given operation. For example, for `{x: 2}` the operand is `2`, for `{x: {$lt:3}}` the operand is `{$lt:3}`, and for {$and:[{x:1},{y:2}]}, the operand is `[{x:1},{y:2}]`.
* **`parts`** - A list of QueryPart for parts contained within the given query part. For example, for `{a:{$not:{$lt: 4}}}` the parts contains the $lt operator, for `{$and:[{x:1},{y:2}]}` there are two elements in `parts`: one for `{x:1}` and one for `{y:2}`.
* **`implicitField`** - If false, it means that the `parts` of this $elemMatch query part contains normal query parts. If true, it means that the `parts` of this $elemMatch query part contains field operators (like $gt or $in) that will have `undefined` `field` properties. `implicitField` will be `undefined` for any QueryPart object who's `operator` is not `"$elemMatch"`.

DotNotationPointers
--------------------

**`var pointers = parser.DotNotationPointers(rootObject, field)`** - A function that returns a list of DotNotationPointer objects, which allow you to get and set a nested property inside a mongo document object using dot notation.

* `rootObject` - an object that may have the given `field`
* `field` - a fieldname, which can be expressed in dot notation (e.g. 'x' and 'x.y.0.z' are both valid for `field`)

Note that this returns a list because a single `field` path can map to many actual properties because of how mongo fans out the matching paths for arrays. For example, `DotNotationPointers({a:[{b:1},{b:2}]},"a.b")` will return two pointers, one pointing to "a.0.b" and one pointing to "a.1.b".

DotNotationPointer
------------------

A pointer that can get and set a nested property within a mongo document object using dot notation. The object has the following properties:

**`pointer.val`** - a getter/setter value that can be used to both get and set the value selected by the `field` passed into the `DotNotationPointers` function. Setting the field to `undefined` will `delete` it from the object.

**`pointer.property`** - an array representing the `field`, split by '.'. For example, for `'a'` this will hold `['a']`, and for `'a.b'` this will hold `['a','b']`.

**`pointer.propertyInfo`** - an object with the following properties:

* `obj` - an object reference for use in getting or setting the value pointed to.
* `last` - the property within `obj` that holds the value pointed to.
